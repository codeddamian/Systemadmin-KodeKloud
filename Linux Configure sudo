We have some users on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
Some of them have been assigned some new roles and responsibilities, therefore their users need to be upgraded with sudo access so that they can perform admin level tasks.

a. Provide sudo access to user ravi on all app servers.

b. Make sure you have set up password-less sudo for the user.

First we have to check if the user is there or not by entereing 
id ravi
that will show if the user is present or not. 

we have to edit sudoers file in every server.
cat /etc/sudoers | grep ravi
vi /etc/sudoers 
open the file entry in the last these line

yousuf      ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD

after that type command 
su ravi 
this command gives login to user without password less login.
