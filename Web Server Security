During recent security audit, application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found some security issues with Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 2 server in Stratos DC. They have listed out some security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the below mentioned security settings:


a. On Nautilus App Server 2 it was identified that Apache web server is exposing the version number. Make appropriate settings on this server to hide the version number of Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/news on App Server 2. It was detected that the directory /news is listing all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart Apache service after making the changes.

    1  sudo systemctl status httpd
    2  sudo systemctl enable httpd
    3  sudo systemctl start httpd
    4  sudo systemctl status httpd
    7  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   
ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off "      ------- ADD THIS LINES IN BELOW TO HIDE VERSION OF APACHE THIS IS TASK A

To hide web server version number, server operating system details, installed Apache modules and more, open your Apache web server configuration file using your favorite editor

    8  sudo systemctl restart httpd
   10  cd /var/www/html/news
   11  ls
   12  sudo vi .htaccess
<Directory /var/www/html/news/>
      Options -Indexes
</Directory>
   13  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf       --CHANGE AllowOverride None to All (AllowOverride All) in <Directory "/var/www/html">
   14 vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Then find the line: Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

Change that line to: Options FollowSymLinks
** While using the .htaccess, make sure that Apache server is enabled to use .htaccess files for that directory. In most cases, .htaccess is disabled by default,
to enable allowoverride to all
** The first directory tag will disable using of .htaccess in /var/www directory. The second directory tag will enable the use of .htaccess under /var/www/html directory.
	<VirtualHost *:80>
 	ServerName example.com
 	
 	# Disable .htaccess for /var/www directory for security
 	<Directory "/var/www">
 	Allowoverride none
 	</Directory>
 		
 	# Enable .htaccess for /var/www/html directory and its subdirectories
 	<Directory "/var/www/html">
 	Allowoverride all
 	</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

   14  sudo systemctl restart httpd
   15  cd
  
Add : curl -l http://stapp03:8080
this commmand output not shows apache version.

curl -l http://stapp03:8080/news
