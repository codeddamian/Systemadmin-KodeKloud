The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . 
App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.


As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS. Please make appropriate changes on this server.


    1  cd /etc/
    2  ls
    3  cat resolv.conf
    4  vi resolv.conf
       search stratos.xfusioncorp.com
       nameserver 8.8.8.8                       --change to DNS server for Google. 8.8.8.8
       options ndots:0
