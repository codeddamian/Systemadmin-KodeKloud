The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories
for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server.
This is one of the pending items from last month, 
so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named epel_local and make sure to set Repository ID to epel_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.

Answer:

#ssh to backup server

    ssh <user>@<server> 

#switch to root user ->   sudo su 

#as per question some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ , verify it

    ls /packages/downloaded_rpms/

* you will see the list of already available packages ( note that you can see the available rpm of question C ( in my case which wget rpm)



# below commands to check already a yum repository is available or not

    yum repolist 

* you will not see any available repo details 

------------------

Create a Repo

------------------

# as per the question need to create a repo named as epel_local and set the ID also same.( check your question)

# navigate to the /etc/yum.repos.d location 

    cd /etc/yum.repos.d

# create a repo with the name 

    vi epel_local.repo

press i to insert mode and paste below ( make sure the name of your repo as given in the question)

    [epel_yum]
    name=epel_local
    baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
    enabled = 1
    gpgcheck = 0
press Esc and wq! to save and close 

# Now verify again using the yum repolist command 

    yum repolist 


    
# now let's do question C part  (in my case, Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.)
