1. Frist in other to Troubleshoot the postfix service. look at the status with the command Systemctl Status postfix 
In this particular task the Error Message was !Fatal: parameter inet_inerfaces; no local interface foudn for ipv6 (::1)

In other cases you might have to look for thefulll error message with thecommand journalctl -xe 

To solve this Error message, Go to the /etc/hosts file and remove the ipv6 line or comment it to make it in active. 


The main task required we configure and install Postfix - yum install postfix -y 
  To configure postfix 
  Postfix configuration files are stored in “/etc/postfix”. The two main postfix configuration files are master.cf and main.cf, although we will only be dealing with main.cf  here.

First we are going to make some additions or changes to the main.cf configuration file. The following lines should be added, edited or uncommented:

The following are the main configuration for the postfix which is in the file “/etc/postfix/main.cf”

myhostname = mail.example.com
mydomain = example.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks = 192.164.0.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
relay_domains =
home_mailbox = Maildir/
If postfix mail server is already  configure on your linux server and you want to create the new email account then you can do it by using following simple commands.

[root@office1 ~]adduser -s /sbin/nologin username;

[root@office1 ~]passwd username

Changing password for user username.
New UNIX password:


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To install Dovecot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$ sudo yum install dovecot
Configure Dovecot
After you install Dovecot, you need to configure the services in the configuration file at /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf. This example uses the nano text editor, but you can use any text editor that you want.

Use the following command to open the file in nano:

$ sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
Uncomment the following lines in the file and, if necessary, change them to reflect your plans for the environment:

protocols = imap pop3
mail_location =  maildir:~/Maildir
These lines contain the following parameters:

protocols: The protocols through which users can access their email
mail_location: The format and the location of each user’s mailbox
Configure the authentication process file
Next you need to configure the authentication process file, which is located at /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf.

Use the following command to open the file in nano:

$ sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
Uncomment the following line in the file and, if necessary, change them to reflect your plans for your environment:

auth_mechanisms = plain login
The auth_mechanisms parameter specifies the method that the email client uses to authenticate with Dovecot.

Configure the mail location
You can set the location for your mail by editing the configuration file at /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf.

Use the following command to open the file in nano:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
Either add or uncomment the following line in the configuration file:

mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
Configure Postfix SMTP authentication
Next you need to configure the UNIX socket for Postfix SMTP authentication (SMTP AUTH). The file that you need to change is located at /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf.

Use the following command to open the file in nano:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
Comment out the following lines:

 #unix_listener auth-userdb {
     #mode = 0600
     #user =
     #group =
   #}
In the same file, edit the following lines:

 # Postfix smtp-auth
   unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
     mode = 0666
     user = postfix
     group = postfix
   }
Configure POP3
Finally, configure the /etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-pop3.conf file, which enables older and less popular email clients to connect and transmit messages correctly.

Use the following command to open this file in nano:

sudo nano /etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-pop3.conf
Uncomment or add the following lines:

pop3_uidl_format = %08Xu%08Xv
pop3_client_workarounds = outlook-no-nuls oe-ns-eoh
Create a mailbox
The example in this section adds a mailbox that a hypothetical user named Joe Bloggs (joe.bloggs) can use to send and receive emails.

You can create a user for this example, or you can use an existing user.

If necessary, use the following command to make a new user:

sudo useradd joe.bloggs
Use the following command to create the mail directory for your user:

sudo mkdir /home/joe.bloggs/Maildir
Give ownership of the mailbox that you just created to joe.bloggs by changing its permissions:

sudo chown joe.bloggs:joe.bloggs /home/joe.bloggs/Maildir
sudo chmod -R 700 /home/joe.bloggs/Maildir
Start Dovecot
Use the following steps to start the Dovecot service:

Use the following chkconfig command to verify that the Dovecot application will run when the server is restarted:

sudo chkconfig --level 345 dovecot on
Use the following command to start the Dovecot service:

sudo service dovecot start
Configure Postfix
Next, you need to configure Postfix to enable your email client to connect to your new SMTP server.

Use the following command to open the file at /etc/postfix/main.cf in nano:

sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
Add the following lines to the file:

 smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
 smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
 smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname
 smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated,permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination
 broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes
 smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot
 smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth
After you have added the preceding lines, exit the main.cf file and restart the Postfix service by using the following command:

sudo service postfix restart
Add ports to iptables
Now that you have enabled secure SMTP Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you should allow connections to port 587 by opening the port for your server in iptables.

Add the rule for this port by entering the following command:

sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 587 -j ACCEPT
Add the POP and IMAP ports, as well as their secure counterparts:

sudo iptables -I INPUT 3 -p tcp --dport 110 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 143 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 993 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -p tcp --dport 995 -j ACCEPT
Use the following commands to save the iptables rules and restart iptables:
Debian/Ubuntu: iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
RHEL/CentOS: iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
