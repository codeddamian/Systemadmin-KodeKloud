The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks
. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need 
to create a bash script named beta_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. 
(Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 1)

a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_beta.zip of /var/www/html/beta directory.
b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 1. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis.
Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.
c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.
d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user
(for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.


cd /script.  directory 
touch beta_backup.sh
#!bin/bash

zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip /var/www/html/beta
scp /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup/

1. go to scripts folder in app server 3 and create a official_backup.sh using above command.
2. make script it won't need password in the future. so we use a ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id command to do that.
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01
3. after that give excute permission to the official_backup.sh script.
   chmod +x beta_backup.sh 
   run the script 
   sh beta_backup.sh
   this will create the zip file of the /var/www/html/beta into /backup folder and also /backup folder on to the natilus backup server
