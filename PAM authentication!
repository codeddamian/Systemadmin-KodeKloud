The document root /var/www/html of all web apps is on NFS share /data on storage server in Stratos Datacenter. We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory in Apache web server document root. We want to password protect http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per below given requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since there are no such specific requirements as of now):


a. We want to use basic authentication.

b. We do not want to use htpasswd file base authentication instead we want to use PAM authentication i.e Basic Auth + PAM. So that we can authenticate with a Linux user itself.

c. We already have a user rose with password dCV3szSGNA which you need to provide access.

d. You can access the website on LBR link, to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal and select option Select port to view on Host 1 and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.

{I AM NOT SURE I DID THESE STEPS ON ALL THREE APP SERVER AS PER QUESTION 1APP IS OK}
    1  systemctl start httpd
    2  systemctl enable httpd
    3  systemctl status httpd  
    4  yum --enablerepo=epel -y install mod_authnz_external pwauth
    5  vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf
<Directory /var/www/html/protected>
    #SSLRequireSSL
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "PAM Authentication"
    AuthBasicProvider external
    AuthExternal pwauth
    require valid-user
</Directory>
    6  systemctl restart httpd
    7  curl -u rose:dCV3szSGNA http://2886795334-80-kitek06g.environments.katacoda.com/protected/
( I GET THIS ABOVE URL AFTER GETTING OUTPUT )

CREATING SSL CERTIFICATES
=========================
	Create a your server's original SSL Certificate. If you use your server as a business, it had better buy and use a Formal Certificate from Verisigh and so on.

    1  systemctl start httpd
    2  systemctl enable httpd
    3  systemctl status httpd
    4  cd /etc/pki/tls/certs
    5  ls
    6  make server.key
    7  openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
    8  make server.csr
    9  openssl x509 -in server.csr -out server.crt -req -signkey server.key -days 3650
   10  chmod 400 server.*


ENABLE & CONFIGURE SSL SETTINGS
===============================

   11  yum -y install mod_ssl
   12  vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
# line 59: uncomment
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

# line 60: uncomment and specify the server name
ServerName 	stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:443

# line 75: change
SSLProtocol -All +TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2

# line 100: change to the one created in [1]
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt

# line 107: change to the one created in [1]
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key

   13  systemctl restart httpd

Basic Auth + PAM
=================  
   14  yum --enablerepo=epel -y install mod_authnz_external pwauth
   15  vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf
<Directory /var/www/html/protected>
    #SSLRequireSSL
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "PAM Authentication"
    AuthBasicProvider external
    AuthExternal pwauth
    require valid-user
</Directory>
   16  systemctl restart httpd


Basic Authentication(using htpasswd)
====================================

   17  systemctl start httpd
   18  systemctl enable httpd
   19  systemctl status httpd
   20  cat /etc/passwd
   21  vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/auth_basic.conf
<Directory /var/www/html/protected>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Basic Authentication"
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/.htpasswd
    require valid-user
</Directory>
   22  htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/conf/.htpasswd ravi     --HERE USERNAME RAVI(# add a user (create a new file with "-c" ? only add "-c" at the first time. Do not add it 2nd time to add users))  
   23  cat /etc/httpd/conf/.htpasswd
   24  systemctl restart httpd
